# XAML and csharp Beginner RPG
 Learning XAML and combining with csharp as a beginner project

This is a beginner project in an effort to learn the fundamentals of XAML while designing the application window for a small RPG.
Coupled with this objective is to further my scripting skills in C#, and working on an object oriented mindset while creating the back-end business logic of the game.
See the Design Document for all game specific design objectives.
